#A Spark App With Extensible Business Logic Using Java SPI

An extensible application is one that you can extend without modifying its original code base. You can enhance its functionality with new plug-ins or modules. Developers, software vendors, and customers can add new functionality or application programming interfaces (APIs) by adding a new Java Archive (JAR) file onto the application class path or into an application-specific extension directory.
